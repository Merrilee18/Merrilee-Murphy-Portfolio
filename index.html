            I have worked as a mentor to college students in Portland, Oregon
            ever since I graduated from college with a degree in Elementary
            Education. Since becoming a mother, I have increasingly desired to
            show my kids what it looks like to never stop growing and always
            challenge yourself. So I stepped into the world of software
            engineering. I'm eager to learn and always striving to be better.
            And I'm so proud to show my kids that you're never too old to try
            something new.

    <!-- this section tells more about me as a developer. Need to get a creative headshot ---->
    <article>

        <p class="about-me">
          During the fall of 2020, I decided to dip my toes into the waters of
          web development. I immediately fell in love with the logic of code
          (usually) and also the creativity. I felt like I was able to bring my
          whole self to the table and contribute fully to projects I was working
          on. I decided that becoming a developer was worth quitting my job and
          attending Thinkful, all in the hopes of launching a brand new career.
          I am gaining confidence in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I'm
          dedicated to learning all that I can, and I'm not afraid to ask
          questions or learn a better way. The last decade of my life has been
          working to develop my communication and I know that I will bring that
          strength to any team that I'm lucky enough to be a part of.
        </p>

      <section id="hobbies" class="hobbies font">
        <p>
          I've always enjoyed expressing my creativity through many platforms.
          When I was younger, I dedicated much of my free time to music. First
          it was classical piano, then I switched to primarily singing. In
          recent years I have entered into different art mediums from painting
          peg dolls to working with leather. I just invested in a pair of roller
          skates so that I can take a break from working on coding to get out
          and get active. I love learning new skills and am never satisfied with
          my current knowledge.

            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Merrilee18/Pomodoro-Timer">
              Pomodoro Timer</a>
               allows you alternate between "focusing" and "break" to help increase productivity. 
              The timer chimes when it's time to take a break and then again when it's time to 
              begin working. You can select the time duration for the focus and break sessions.

              The Library Project</a> is organizing an imaginary Library. 
              I created functions to organize the books, authors, and accounts. 
              It tested my ability to write complicated algorithms and write practical functions. 
              Different abilities include searching for the most common authors, 
              searching for the most popular books, and displaying authors by genre.

            allows you to create virtual flashcards to help you study. You can create different decks

            Flip through the deck to study! Manage the deck and cards easily by adding, editing, 
            and deleting.

          <p class="projects">
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Merrilee18/Decoder_Ring">
            The Decoder Ring </a> is a fun project that has 
            three different decoders: Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, and Substitution Cypher. 
            Each decoder allows you to chose between encoding and decoding. 
            The main use of this project is simply for a fun party game or escape room.
              <br>
            This project not only tested my ability to write challenging algorithms, 
            it also challenged me in my ability to write tests using Mocha and Chai.

        I have worked as a mentor to college students in Portland, Oregon
        ever since I graduated from college with a degree in Elementary Education.
        Since becoming a mother, I have increasingly desired to show my kids what
        it looks like to never stop growing and always challenge yourself.
        So I stepped into the world of software engineering. I'm eager to learn
        and always striving to be better. And I'm so proud to show my kids that you're never
        too old to try something new.

      <p class="about-me">
        During the fall of 2020, I decided to dip my toes into the waters of
        web development. I immediately fell in love with the logic of code (usually)
        and also the creativity. I felt like I was able to bring my whole self to the
        table and contribute. I decided that becoming a developer was worth quitting my job and
        attending Thinkful, all in the hopes of beginning a brand new career.
        I am gaining confidence in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm dedicated to learning
        all that I can, and I'm not afraid to ask questions or learn a better way. The last decade
        of my life has been working to develop my communication and I know that I will bring
        that strength to any team that I'm lucky enough to be a part of.

        I've always enjoyed expressing my creativity through many platforms. When I was younger,
        I dedicated much of my free time to music. First it was classical piano, then I switched
        to primarily singing. In recent years I have entered into different art mediums from
        painting peg dolls to working with leather.
        I just invested in a pair of roller skates
        so that I can take a break from working on coding to get out and get active. I love learning
        new skills and am never satisfied with my current knowledge.
